      Welcome to the 2048 Game! Here's how to play:
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Use the arrow keys or swipe gestures to move the tiles.</li>
      <li>When you move a tile, a new tile with a value of either 2 will appear in a random empty spot on the board.</li>
      <li>If two tiles with the same value collide when moved, they will merge into a single tile with the sum of their values.</li>
      <li>The goal is to create a tile with the value of <strong>2048</strong> by merging tiles.</li>
      <li>The game ends when you can no longer make any moves.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="bottom">
      Remember, strategic placement of tiles is key to achieving a high score! Pay attention to the entire board and plan your moves accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
